# Applied-NLP-2020

This repository consists of the data used and the code used for the Applied NLP project of the Information Retrieval (IN4325) course at TU Delft. The purpose of this study was to determine which features are useful in predicting clickbait headlines.

The coding was done in Python 3 using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and is provided as a set of Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository consists of 2 directories:
* [**dataset**](https://github.com/ShoCremers/Applied-NLP-2020/tree/master/dataset): contains the dataset used as well as the features generated.
* [**src**](https://github.com/ShoCremers/Applied-NLP-2020/tree/master/src): contains the code for feature generation, the code for generating feature importance as well as the code for the classification.
